# QuickPrompt Privacy Policy

## Data Collection
QuickPrompt does not collect, store, or transmit any user data outside of your browser.

## Local Storage
The only data stored by QuickPrompt is:
1. Your preferred AI assistant choice (ChatGPT or Claude)
2. Your theme preference (light or dark mode)

This information is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's built-in storage API and is not accessible to the extension developer or any third parties.

## Third-Party Services
When you use the extension to interact with AI assistants:
- The extension opens tabs to official websites (chat.openai.com or claude.ai)
- Any data you share with these services is subject to their respective privacy policies
- QuickPrompt itself does not process, intercept, or store any of these interactions

## Permissions
QuickPrompt requests only the minimum permissions needed for its functionality:
- storage: To remember your preferences
- contextMenus: To add right-click options
- tabs: To open AI assistant websites
- activeTab: To access the currently active tab when you explicitly use the extension
- scripting: To help automatically submit queries to Claude
- Host permission (claude.ai): To enable seamless integration with Claude

## Updates
This privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes in the extension's functionality. Any significant changes will be communicated through the Chrome Web Store listing.

## Contact
If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through the Chrome Web Store support channel.
